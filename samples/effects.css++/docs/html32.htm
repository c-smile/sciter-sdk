<H2>Abstract</H2>
<HR>
<P>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used to 
create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML 
documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for 
representing information from a wide range of applications. This specification 
defines HTML version 3.2. HTML 3.2 aims to capture recommended practice as of 
early '96 and as such to be used as a replacement for HTML 2.0 (<A 
href="#refs">RFC 
1866</A>).

<H2><A name=intro>Introduction to HTML 3.2</A></H2>
<P>HTML 3.2 is W3C's specification for HTML, developed in early `96 together 
with vendors including IBM, Microsoft, Netscape Communications Corporation, 
Novell, SoftQuad, Spyglass, and Sun Microsystems. HTML 3.2 adds widely deployed 
features such as tables, applets and text flow around images, while providing 
full backwards compatibility with the existing standard HTML 2.0. 
<P>W3C is continuing to work with vendors on extensions for accessibility 
features, multimedia objects, scripting, style sheets, layout, forms, math and 
internationalization. W3C plans on incorporating this work in further versions 
of HTML. 
<H3><A name=sgml>HTML as an SGML Application</A></H3>
<P>HTML 3.2 is an SGML application conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 
-- Standard Generalized Markup Language. As an SGML application, the syntax of 
conforming HTML 3.2 documents is defined by the combination of the <A 
href="#sgmldecl">SGML 
declaration</A> and the <A 
href="#dtd">document 
type definition</A> (DTD). This specification defines the intended 
interpretation of HTML 3.2 elements, and places further constraints on the 
permitted syntax which are otherwise inexpressible in the DTD. 
<P>The SGML rules for record boundaries are tricky. In particular, a record end 
immediately following a start tag should be discarded. For example: <PRE>&lt;P&gt;
Text</PRE>
<P>is equivalent to:</P><PRE>&lt;P&gt;Text</PRE>
<P>Similarly, a record end immediately preceding an end tag should be discarded. 
For example: <PRE>Text
&lt;/P&gt;</PRE>
<P>is equivalent to: </P><PRE>Text&lt;/P&gt;</PRE>
<P>Except within literal text (e.g. the <SAMP>PRE</SAMP> element), HTML treats 
contiguous sequences of white space characters as being equivalent to a single 
space character (ASCII decimal 32). These rules allow authors considerable 
flexibility when editing the marked-up text directly. Note that future revisions 
to HTML may allow for the interpretation of the horizontal tab character (ASCII 
decimal 9) with respect to a tab rule defined by an associated style sheet. 
<P>SGML entities in PCDATA content or in CDATA attributes are expanded by the 
parser, e.g. <SAMP>&amp;#233;</SAMP> is expanded to the ISO Latin-1 character 
decimal 233 (a lower case letter e with an acute accent). This could also have 
been written as a named character entity, e.g. <SAMP>&amp;eacute;</SAMP>. The 
&amp; character can be included in its own right using the named character 
entity <SAMP>&amp;amp;</SAMP>. 
<P>HTML allows CDATA attributes to be unquoted provided the attribute value 
contains only letters (a to z and A to Z), digits (0 to 9), hyphens (ASCII 
decimal 45) or, periods (ASCII decimal 46). Attribute values can be quoted using 
double or single quote marks (ASCII decimal 34 and 39 respectively). Single 
quote marks can be included within the attribute value when the value is 
delimited by double quote marks, and vice versa. 
<P>Note that some user agents require attribute minimisation for the following 
attributes: <SAMP>COMPACT</SAMP>, <SAMP>ISMAP</SAMP>, <SAMP>CHECKED</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>NOWRAP</SAMP>, <SAMP>NOSHADE</SAMP> and <SAMP>NOHREF</SAMP>. These user 
agents don't accept syntax such as <SAMP>COMPACT=COMPACT</SAMP> or 
<SAMP>ISMAP=ISMAP</SAMP> although this is legitimate according to the HTML 3.2 
DTD. 
<P>The SGML declaration and the DTD for use with HTML 3.2 are given in 
appendices. Further guidelines for parsing HTML are given in <A 
href="#refs">WD-html-lex</A>. 

<HR>

<H3><A name=html>The Structure of HTML documents</A></H3>
<P>HTML 3.2 Documents start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration followed by an 
HTML element containing a <A 
href="#head"><SAMP>HEAD</SAMP></A> 
and then a <A 
href="#body"><SAMP>BODY</SAMP></A> 
element: <PRE>  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;
  &lt;HTML&gt;
  &lt;HEAD&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;A study of population dynamics&lt;/TITLE&gt;
  <I>... other head elements</I>
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;BODY&gt;
  <I>... document body</I>
  &lt;/BODY&gt;
  &lt;/HTML&gt;</PRE>
<P>In practice, the <SAMP>HTML</SAMP>, <A 
href="#head"><SAMP>HEAD</SAMP></A> 
and <A 
href="#body"><SAMP>BODY</SAMP></A> 
start and end tags can be omitted from the markup as these can be inferred in 
all cases by parsers conforming to the <A 
href="#dtd">HTML 
3.2 DTD</A>. 
<P>Every conforming HTML 3.2 document <B>must</B> start with the 
<SAMP>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</SAMP> declaration that is needed to distinguish HTML 3.2 
documents from other versions of HTML. The HTML specification is not concerned 
with storage entities. As a result, it is not required that the document type 
declaration reside in the same storage entity (i.e. file). A Web site may choose 
to dynamically prepend HTML files with the document type declaration if it is 
known that all such HTML files conform to the HTML 3.2 specification. 
<P>Every HTML 3.2 document must also include the descriptive title element. A 
minimal HTML 3.2 document thus looks like: <PRE>  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;
  &lt;TITLE&gt;A study of population dynamics&lt;/TITLE&gt;</PRE>
<P><I>Note: the word "Final" replaces "Draft" now that the HTML 3.2 
specification has been ratified by the W3C member organizations.</I> 
<HR>

<H2><A name=head>The HEAD element</A></H2>
<P>This contains the document head, but you can always omit both the start and 
end tags for <SAMP>HEAD</SAMP>. The contents of the document head is an 
unordered collection of the following elements: 
<UL>
  <LI><A 
  href="#title">The 
  TITLE element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#script">The 
  STYLE element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#script">The 
  SCRIPT element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#isindex">The 
  ISINDEX element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#base">The 
  BASE element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#meta">The 
  META element</A> 
  <LI><A 
  href="#link">The 
  LINK element</A> </LI></UL><PRE>&lt;!ENTITY % head.content "TITLE &amp; ISINDEX? &amp; BASE?"&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % head.misc "SCRIPT|STYLE|META|LINK"&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT HEAD O O  (%head.content) +(%head.misc)&gt;</PRE>
<P>The %head.misc entity is used to allow the associated elements to occur 
multiple times at arbitrary positions within the HEAD. The following elements 
can be part of the document head: 
<DL>
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#title">TITLE</A></B> 
  defines the document title, and is always needed. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#isindex">ISINDEX</A></B> 
  for simple keyword searches, see <SAMP>PROMPT</SAMP> attribute. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#base">BASE</A></B> 
  defines base URL for resolving relative URLs. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#script">SCRIPT</A></B> 
  reserved for future use with scripting languages. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#style">STYLE</A></B> 
  reserved for future use with style sheets. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#meta">META</A></B> 
  used to supply meta info as name/value pairs. 
  <DT><B><A 
  href="#link">LINK</A></B> 
  used to define relationships with other documents. </DT></DL>
<P><SAMP>TITLE</SAMP>, <SAMP>SCRIPT</SAMP> and <SAMP>STYLE</SAMP> are containers 
and require both start and end tags. The other elements are not containers so 
that end tags are forbidden. Note that conforming browsers won't render the 
contents of <SAMP>SCRIPT</SAMP> and <SAMP>STYLE</SAMP> elements. 
<H3><A name=title>TITLE</A></H3><PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT TITLE - -  (#PCDATA)* -(%head.misc)&gt;</PRE>
<P>Every HTML 3.2 document <B>must</B> have exactly one <SAMP>TITLE</SAMP> 
element in the document's <SAMP>HEAD</SAMP>. It provides an advisory title which 
can be displayed in a user agent's window caption etc. The content model is 
PCDATA. As a result, character entities can be used for accented characters and 
to escape special characters such as &amp; and &lt;. Markup is not permitted in 
the content of a <SAMP>TITLE</SAMP> element. 
<P>Example TITLE element: <PRE>    &lt;TITLE&gt;A study of population dynamics&lt;/TITLE&gt;</PRE>
<H3><A name=style>STYLE</A> and <A name=script>SCRIPT</A></H3><PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT STYLE  - - CDATA -- placeholder for style info --&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT SCRIPT - - CDATA -- placeholder for script statements --&gt;
</PRE>
<P>These are place holders for the introduction of style sheets and client-side 
scripts in future versions of HTML. User agents should hide the contents of 
these elements. 
<P>These elements are defined with CDATA as the content type. As a result they 
may contain only SGML characters. All markup characters or delimiters are 
ignored and passed as data to the application, except for ETAGO ("&lt;/") 
delimiters followed immediately by a name character [a-zA-Z]. This means that 
the element's end-tag (or that of an element in which it is nested) is 
recognized, while an error occurs if the ETAGO is invalid. 
<H3><A name=isindex>ISINDEX</A></H3><PRE>    &lt;!ELEMENT ISINDEX - O EMPTY&gt;
    &lt;!ATTLIST ISINDEX
        prompt CDATA #IMPLIED -- prompt message --&gt;</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>ISINDEX</SAMP> element indicates that the user agent should provide 
a single line text input field for entering a query string. There are no 
restrictions on the number of characters that can be entered. The 
<SAMP>PROMPT</SAMP> attribute can be used to specify a prompt string for the 
input field, e.g. <PRE>    &lt;ISINDEX PROMPT="Search Phrase"&gt;</PRE>
<P>The semantics for <SAMP>ISINDEX</SAMP> are currently well defined only when 
the base URL for the enclosing document is an HTTP URL. Typically, when the user 
presses the enter (return) key, the query string is sent to the server 
identified by the base URL for this document. For example, if the query string 
entered is "ten green apples" and the base URL is: <PRE>    http://www.acme.com/</PRE>
<P>then the query generated is: <PRE>    http://www.acme.com/?ten+green+apples"</PRE>
<P>Note that space characters are mapped to "+" characters and that normal URL 
character escaping mechanisms apply. For further details see the <A 
href="#refs">HTTP</A> 
specification. 
<P><I><B>Note</B> in practice, the query string is resticted to Latin-1 as there 
is no current mechanism for the URL to specify a character set for the 
query.</I> 
<H3><A name=base>BASE</A></H3><PRE>    &lt;!ELEMENT BASE - O EMPTY&gt;
    &lt;!ATTLIST BASE
        href %URL  #REQUIRED
        &gt;</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>BASE</SAMP> element gives the base URL for dereferencing relative 
URLs, using the rules given by the URL specification, e.g. <PRE>    &lt;BASE href="http://www.acme.com/intro.html"&gt;
     ...
    &lt;IMG SRC="icons/logo.gif"&gt;</PRE>
<P>The image is deferenced to <PRE>    http://www.acme.com/icons/logo.gif</PRE>
<P>In the absence of a <SAMP>BASE</SAMP> element the document URL should be 
used. Note that this is not necessarily the same as the URL used to request the 
document, as the base URL may be overridden by an HTTP header accompanying the 
document. 
<H3><A name=meta>META</A></H3><PRE>&lt;!ELEMENT META - O EMPTY    -- Generic Metainformation --&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST META
        http-equiv  NAME    #IMPLIED  -- HTTP response header name  --
        name        NAME    #IMPLIED  -- metainformation name       --
        content     CDATA   #REQUIRED -- associated information     --
        &gt;
</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>META</SAMP> element can be used to include name/value pairs 
describing properties of the document, such as author, expiry date, a list of 
key words etc. The <SAMP>NAME</SAMP> attribute specifies the property name while 
the <SAMP>CONTENT</SAMP> attribute specifies the property value, e.g. <PRE>    &lt;META NAME="Author" CONTENT="Dave Raggett"&gt;</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>HTTP-EQUIV</SAMP> attribute can be used in place of the 
<SAMP>NAME</SAMP> attribute and has a special significance when documents are 
retrieved via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP servers may use the 
property name specified by the HTTP-EQUIV attribute to create an RFC 822 style 
header in the HTTP response. This can't be used to set certain HTTP headers 
though, see the HTTP specification for details. <PRE>    &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Expires" CONTENT="Tue, 20 Aug 1996 14:25:27 GMT"&gt;</PRE>
<P>will result in the HTTP header: <PRE>    Expires: Tue, 20 Aug 1996 14:25:27 GMT</PRE>
<P>This can be used by caches to determine when to fetch a fresh copy of the 
associated document. 
<H3><A name=link>LINK</A></H3>
<P><SAMP>LINK</SAMP> provides a media independent method for defining 
relationships with other documents and resources. <SAMP>LINK</SAMP> has been 
part of HTML since the very early days, although few browsers as yet take 
advantage of it (most still ignore <SAMP>LINK</SAMP> elements). 
<P>LINK elements can be used <EM>in principle</EM>: 
<OL type=a>
  <LI>for document specific navigation toolbars or menus 
  <LI>to control how collections of HTML files are rendered into printed 
  documents 
  <LI>for linking associated resources such as style sheets and scripts 
  <LI>to provide alternative forms of the current document </LI></OL><PRE>    &lt;!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY&gt;
    &lt;!ATTLIST LINK

</PRE>
<DL>
  <DT><B>href</B> 
  <DD>Specifies a URL designating the linked resource. 
  <DT><B>rel</B> 
  <DD>The forward relationship also known as the "link type". It specifies a 
  named relationship from the enclosing document to the resource specified by 
  the <SAMP>HREF</SAMP> attribute. HTML link relationships are as yet 
  unstandardized, although some conventions have been established. 
  <DT><B>rev</B> 
  <DD>This defines a reverse relationship. A link from document A to document B 
  with <SAMP>REV=<EM>relation</EM></SAMP> expresses the same relationship as a 
  link from B to A with <SAMP>REL=<EM>relation</EM></SAMP>. 
  <SAMP>REV=made</SAMP> is sometimes used to identify the document author, 
  either the author's email address with a mailto URL, or a link to the author's 
  home page. 
  <DT><B>title</B> 
  <DD>An advisory title for the linked resource. </DD></DL>
<P>Here are some proposed relationship values: 
<DL>
  <DT><SAMP>rel=top</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references the top of a hierarchy, e.g. the first or cover page 
  in a collection. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=contents</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references a document serving as a table of contents. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=index</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references a document providing an index for the current 
  document. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=glossary</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references a document providing a glossary of terms that are 
  relevant to the current document. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=copyright</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references a copyright statement for the current document. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=next</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references the next document to visit in a guided tour. It can be 
  used, for example, to preload the next page. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=previous</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references the previous document in a guided tour. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=help</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references a document offering help, e.g. describing the wider 
  context and offering further links to relevant documents. This is aimed at 
  reorienting users who have lost their way. 
  <DT><SAMP>rel=search</SAMP> 
  <DD>The link references a page for searching material related to a collection 
  of pages </DD></DL>
<P>Example <SAMP>LINK</SAMP> elements: <PRE>    &lt;LINK REL=Contents HREF=toc.html&gt;

<H3><A name=level>Block and Text level elements</A></H3>
<P>Most elements that can appear in the document body fall into one of two 
groups: block level elements which cause paragraph breaks, and text level 
elements which don't. Common block level elements include <SAMP>H1</SAMP> to 
<SAMP>H6</SAMP> (headers), <SAMP>P</SAMP> (paragraphs) <SAMP>LI</SAMP> (list 
items), and <SAMP>HR</SAMP> (horizontal rules). Common text level elements 
include <SAMP>EM</SAMP>, <SAMP>I</SAMP>, <SAMP>B</SAMP> and <SAMP>FONT</SAMP> 
(character emphasis), <SAMP>A</SAMP> (hypertext links), <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>APPLET</SAMP> (embedded objects) and <SAMP>BR</SAMP> (line breaks). Note 
that block elements generally act as containers for text level and other block 
level elements (excluding headings and address elements), while text level 
elements can only contain other text level elements. The exact model depends on 
the element. 
<H3><A name=headings>Headings</A></H3><PRE>&lt;!--
  There are six levels of headers from H1 (the most important)
  to H6 (the least important).

<P><SAMP>H1</SAMP>, <SAMP>H2</SAMP>, <SAMP>H3</SAMP>, <SAMP>H4</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>H5</SAMP> and <SAMP>H6</SAMP> are used for document headings. You always 
need the start and end tags. <SAMP>H1</SAMP> elements are more important than 
<SAMP>H2</SAMP> elements and so on, so that <SAMP>H6</SAMP> elements define the 
least important level of headings. More important headings are generally 
rendered in a larger font than less important ones. Use the optional 
<SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute to set the text alignment within a heading, e.g. <PRE>  &lt;H1 ALIGN=CENTER&gt; <I>... centered heading ...</I> &lt;/H1&gt;</PRE>
<P>The default is left alignment, but this can be overridden by an enclosing <A

element. 
<H3><A name=address>ADDRESS</A></H3><PRE>    &lt;!ENTITY % address.content "((%text;) | P)*"&gt;

    &lt;!ELEMENT ADDRESS - - %address.content&gt;</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>ADDRESS</SAMP> element requires start and end tags, and specifies 
information such as authorship and contact details for the current document. 
User agents should render the content with paragraph-breaks before and after. 
Note that the content is restricted to paragraphs, plain text and text-like 
elements as defined by the %text entity.

        &gt;</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>P</SAMP> element is used to markup paragraphs. It is a container 
and requires a start tag. The end tag is optional as it can always be inferred 
by the parser. User agents should place paragraph breaks before and after 
<SAMP>P</SAMP> elements. The rendering is user agent dependent, but text is 
generally wrapped to fit the space available. 
<P>Example: <PRE>    &lt;P&gt;This is the first paragraph.
    &lt;P&gt;This is the second paragraph.</PRE>
<P>Paragraphs are usually rendered flush left with a ragged right margin. The 
<SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute can be used to explicitly specify the horizontal 
alignment: 
<DL>
  <DT><SAMP>align=left</SAMP>
  <DD>The paragraph is rendered flush left. 
  <DT><SAMP>align=center</SAMP>
  <DD>The paragraph is centered.

  <DD>The paragraph is rendered flush right. </DD></DL>
<P>For example: <PRE>&lt;p align=center&gt;This is a centered paragraph.

        &gt;</PRE>
<P>These elements have been part of HTML from the early days. They are intended 
for unordered lists similar to <SAMP>UL</SAMP> elements. User agents are 
recommended to render <SAMP>DIR</SAMP> elements as multicolumn directory lists, 
and <SAMP>MENU</SAMP> elements as single column menu lists. In practice, Mosaic 
and most other user agents have ignored this advice and instead render 
<SAMP>DIR</SAMP> and <SAMP>MENU</SAMP> in an identical way to <SAMP>UL</SAMP> 
elements.

&lt;!ATTLIST PRE
        width NUMBER #implied
        &gt;</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>PRE</SAMP> element can be used to include preformatted text. User 
agents render this in a fixed pitch font, preserving spacing associated with 
white space characters such as space and newline characters. Automatic word-wrap 
should be disabled within <SAMP>PRE</SAMP> elements. 
<P>Note that the SGML standard requires that the parser remove a newline 
immediately following the start tag or immediately preceding the end tag. 
<P><SAMP>PRE</SAMP> has the same content model as paragraphs, excluding images 
and elements that produce changes in font size, e.g. <SAMP>IMG</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>BIG</SAMP>, <SAMP>SMALL</SAMP>, <SAMP>SUB</SAMP>, <SAMP>SUP</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>FONT</SAMP>. 
<P>A few user agents support the <SAMP>WIDTH</SAMP> attribute. It provides a 
hint to the user agent of the required width in characters. The user agent can 
use this to select an appropriate font size or to indent the content 
appropriately. 
<P>Here is an example of a <SAMP>PRE</SAMP> element; a verse from Shelley (To a 
Skylark): <PRE>&lt;PRE&gt;
       Higher still and higher
         From the earth thou springest
       Like a cloud of fire;
         The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
&lt;/PRE&gt;</PRE>which is rendered as: <PRE>       Higher still and higher
         From the earth thou springest
       Like a cloud of fire;
         The blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.</PRE>
<P>The horizontal tab character (encoded in Unicode, US ASCII and ISO 8859-1 as 
decimal 9) should be interpreted as the smallest non-zero number of spaces which 
will leave the number of characters so far on the line as a multiple of 8. Its 
use is strongly discouraged since it is common practice when editing to set the 
tab-spacing to other values, leading to misaligned documents.

&lt;!ELEMENT center - - %body.content&gt;</PRE>
<P><SAMP>DIV</SAMP> elements can be used to structure HTML documents as a

default horizontal alignment for elements within the content of the

<SAMP>CENTER</SAMP> or <SAMP>RIGHT</SAMP>, and is defined in the same way as for 
the paragraph element <SAMP>&lt;P&gt;</SAMP>. 
<P>Note that because <SAMP>DIV</SAMP> is a block-like element it will terminate 
an open <SAMP>P</SAMP> element. Other than this, user agents are <B>not</B> 
expected to render paragraph breaks before and after <SAMP>DIV</SAMP> elements.

<P>Tables take the general form: <PRE>  &lt;TABLE BORDER=3 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH="80%"&gt;
  &lt;CAPTION&gt;<I> ... table caption ...</I> &lt;/CAPTION&gt;
  &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt; <I>first cell</I> &lt;TD&gt; <I>second cell</I>
  &lt;TR&gt; ...
  ...
  &lt;/TABLE&gt;</PRE>
<P>The attributes on <SAMP>TABLE</SAMP> are all optional. By default, the table 
is rendered without a surrounding border. The table is generally sized 
automatically to fit the contents, but you can also set the table width using 
the <SAMP>WIDTH</SAMP> attribute. <SAMP>BORDER</SAMP>, <SAMP>CELLSPACING</SAMP> 
and <SAMP>CELLPADDING</SAMP> provide further control over the table's 
appearence. Captions are rendered at the top or bottom of the table depending on 
the <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute. 
<P>Each table row is contained in a <SAMP>TR</SAMP> element, although the end 
tag can always be omitted. Table cells are defined by <SAMP>TD</SAMP> elements 
for data and <SAMP>TH</SAMP> elements for headers. Like <SAMP>TR</SAMP>, these 
are containers and can be given without trailing end tags. <SAMP>TH</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>TD</SAMP> support several attributes: <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>VALIGN</SAMP> for aligning cell content, <SAMP>ROWSPAN</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>COLSPAN</SAMP> for cells which span more than one row or column. A cell 
can contain a wide variety of other block and text level elements including form 
fields and other tables. 
<P>The <SAMP>TABLE</SAMP> element always requires both start and end tags. It 
supports the following attributes: 
<DL>
  <DT><B>align</B> 
  <DD>This takes one of the case insensitive values: <SAMP>LEFT</SAMP>, 
  <SAMP>CENTER</SAMP> or <SAMP>RIGHT</SAMP>. It specifies the horizontal 
  placement of the table relative to the current left and right margins. It 
  defaults to left alignment, but this can be overridden by an enclosing <A 
  href="#div"><SAMP>DIV</SAMP></A> 
  or <A 
  href="#center"><SAMP>CENTER</SAMP></A> 
  element. 
  <DT><B>width</B> 
  <DD>In the absence of this attribute the table width is automatically 
  determined from the table contents. You can use the <SAMP>WIDTH</SAMP> 
  attribute to set the table width to a fixed value in pixels (e.g. 
  <SAMP>WIDTH=212</SAMP>) or as a percentage of the space between the current 
  left and right margins (e.g. <SAMP>WIDTH="80%"</SAMP>). 
  <DT><B>border</B> 
  <DD>This attribute can be used to specify the width of the outer border around 
  the table to a given number of pixels (e.g. <SAMP>BORDER=4</SAMP>). The value 
  can be set to zero to suppress the border altogether. In the absence of this 
  attribute the border should be suppressed. Note that some browsers also accept 
  <SAMP>&lt;TABLE BORDER&gt;</SAMP> with the same semantics as 
  <SAMP>BORDER=1</SAMP>. 
  <DT><B>cellspacing</B> 
  <DD>In traditional desktop publishing software, adjacent table cells share a 
  common border. This is not the case in HTML. Each cell is given its own border 
  which is separated from the borders around neighboring cells. This separation 
  can be set in pixels using the <SAMP>CELLSPACING</SAMP> attribute, (e.g. 
  <SAMP>CELLSPACING=10</SAMP>). The same value also determines the separation 
  between the table border and the borders of the outermost cells. 
  <DT><B>cellpadding</B> 
  <DD>This sets the padding in pixels between the border around each cell and 
  the cell's contents. </DD></DL>
<P>The <SAMP>CAPTION</SAMP> element has one attribute <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> which 
can be either <SAMP>ALIGN=TOP</SAMP> or <SAMP>ALIGN=BOTTOM</SAMP>. This can be 
used to force the caption to be placed above the top or below the bottom of the 
table respectively. Most user agents default to placing the caption above the 
table. <SAMP>CAPTION</SAMP> always requires both start and end tags. Captions 
are limited to plain text and text-level elements as defined by the %text 
entity. Block level elements are not permitted. 
<P>The <SAMP>TR</SAMP> or table row element requires a start tag, but the end 
tag can always be left out. <SAMP>TR</SAMP> acts as a container for table cells. 
It has two attributes: 
<DL>
  <DT><B>align</B> 
  <DD>Sets the default horizontal alignment of cell contents. It takes one of 
  the case insensitive values: <SAMP>LEFT</SAMP>, <SAMP>CENTER</SAMP> or 
  <SAMP>RIGHT</SAMP> and plays the same role as the <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute 
  on paragraph elements. 
  <DT><B>valign</B> 
  <DD>This can be used to set the default vertical alignment of cell contents 
  within each cell. It takes one of the case insensitive values: 
  <SAMP>TOP</SAMP>, <SAMP>MIDDLE</SAMP> or <SAMP>BOTTOM</SAMP> to position the 
  cell contents at the top, middle or bottom of the cell respectively. </DD></DL>
<P>There are two elements for defining table cells. <SAMP>TH</SAMP> is used for 
header cells and <SAMP>TD</SAMP> for data cells. This distinction allows user 
agents to render header and data cells in different fonts, and enables speech 
based browsers to do a better job. The start tags for <SAMP>TH</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>TD</SAMP> are always needed but the end tags can be left out. Table cells 
can have the following attributes: 
<DL>
  <DT><B>nowrap</B> 
  <DD>The presence of this attribute disables automatic word wrap within the 
  contents of this cell (e.g. <SAMP>&lt;TD NOWRAP&gt;</SAMP>). This is 
  equivalent to using the <SAMP>&amp;nbsp;</SAMP> entity for non-breaking spaces 
  within the content of the cell. 
  <DT><B>rowspan</B> 
  <DD>This takes a positive integer value specifying the number of rows spanned 
  by this cell. It defaults to one. 
  <DT><B>colspan</B> 
  <DD>This takes a positive integer value specifying the number of columns 
  spanned by this cell. It defaults to one. 
  <DT><B>align</B> 
  <DD>Specifies the default horizontal alignment of cell contents, and overrides 
  the <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute on the table row. It takes the same values: 
  <SAMP>LEFT</SAMP>, <SAMP>CENTER</SAMP> and <SAMP>RIGHT</SAMP>. If you don't 
  specify an <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute value on the cell, the default is left 
  alignment for <SAMP>&lt;td&gt;</SAMP> and center alignment for 
  <SAMP>&lt;th&gt;</SAMP> although you can override this with an 
  <SAMP>ALIGN</SAMP> attribute on the <SAMP>TR</SAMP> element. 
  <DT><B>valign</B> 
  <DD>Specifies the default vertical alignment of cell contents, overriding the 
  <SAMP>VALIGN</SAMP> attribute on the table row. It takes the same values: 
  <SAMP>TOP</SAMP>, <SAMP>MIDDLE</SAMP> and <SAMP>BOTTOM</SAMP>. If you don't 
  specify a VALIGN attribute value on the cell, the default is middle although 
  you can override this with a <SAMP>VALIGN</SAMP> attribute on the 
  <SAMP>TR</SAMP> element. 
  <DT><B>width</B> 
  <DD>Specifies the suggested width for a cell content in pixels excluding the 
  cell padding. This value will normally be used except when it conflicts with 
  the width requirements for other cells in the same column. 
  <DT><B>height</B> 
  <DD>Specifies the suggested height for a cell content in pixels excluding the 
  cell padding. This value will normally be used except when it conflicts with 
  the height requirements for other cells in the same row. </DD></DL>
<P>Tables are commonly rendered in bas-relief, raised up with the outer border 
as a bevel, and individual cells inset into this raised surface. Borders around 
individual cells are only drawn if the cell has explicit content. White space 
doesn't count for this purpose with the exception of &amp;nbsp;. 
<P>The algorithms used to automatically size tables should take into account the 
minimum and maximum width requirements for each cell. This is used to determine 
the minimum and maximum width requirements for each column and hence for the 
table itself. 
<P>Cells spanning more than one column contribute to the widths of each of the 
columns spanned. One approach is to evenly apportion the cell's minimum and 
maximum width between these columns, another is to weight the apportioning 
according to the contributions from cells that don't span multiple columns. 
<P>For some user agents it may be necessary or desirable to break text lines 
within words. In such cases a visual indication that this has occurred is 
advised. 
<P>The minimum and maximum width of nested tables contribute to the minimum and 
maximum width of the cell in which they occur. Once the width requirements are 
known for the top level table, the column widths for that table can be assigned. 
This allows the widths of nested tables to be assigned and hence in turn the 
column widths of such tables. If practical, all columns should be assigned at 
least their minimum widths. It is suggested that any surplus space is then 
shared out proportional to the difference between the minimum and maximum width 
requirements of each column. 
<P>Note that pixel values for width and height refer to screen pixels, and 
should be multiplied by an appropriate factor when rendering to very high 
resolution devices such as laser printers. For instance if a user agent has a 
display with 75 pixels per inch and is rendering to a laser printer with 600 
dots per inch, then the pixel values given in HTML attributes should be 
multiplied by a factor of 8.

  <DL>
    <DT><SAMP>type=text</SAMP> <EM>(the default)</EM> 
    <DD>A single line text field whose visible size can be set using the <A 
    href="#isize"><SAMP>size</SAMP></A> 
    attribute, e.g. <SAMP>size=40</SAMP> for a 40 character wide field. Users 
    should be able to type more than this limit though with the text scrolling 
    through the field to keep the input cursor in view. You can enforce an upper 
    limit on the number of characters that can be entered with the <A 
    href="#maxlen"><SAMP>maxlength</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. The <A 
    href="#name"><SAMP>name</SAMP></A> 
    attribute is used to name the field, while the <A 
    href="#value"><SAMP>value</SAMP></A> 
    attribute can be used to initialize the text string shown in the field when 
    the document is first loaded. <PRE>    &lt;input type=text size=40 name=user value="your name"&gt;</PRE>
    <DT><SAMP>type=password</SAMP> 
    <DD>This is like type=text, but echoes characters using a character like * 
    to hide the text from prying eyes when entering passwords. You can use <A 
    href="#isize"><SAMP>size</SAMP></A> 
    and <A 
    href="#maxlen"><SAMP>maxlength</SAMP></A> 
    attributes to control the visible and maximum length exactly as per regular 
    text fields. <PRE>    &lt;input type=password size=12 name=pw&gt;</PRE>
    <DT><SAMP>type=checkbox</SAMP> 
    <DD>Used for simple Boolean attributes, or for attributes that can take 
    multiple values at the same time. The latter is represented by several 
    checkbox fields with the same <A 
    href="#name"><SAMP>name</SAMP></A> 
    and a different <A 
    href="#value"><SAMP>value</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. Each checked checkbox generates a separate name/value pair in the 
    submitted data, even if this results in duplicate names. Use the <A 
    href="#checked"><SAMP>checked</SAMP></A> 
    attribute to initialize the checkbox to its checked state. <PRE>    &lt;input type=checkbox checked name=uscitizen value=yes&gt;</PRE>
    <DT><SAMP>type=radio</SAMP> 
    <DD>Used for attributes which can take a single value from a set of 
    alternatives. Each radio button field in the group should be given the same 
    <A 
    href="#name"><SAMP>name</SAMP></A>. 
    Radio buttons require an explicit <A 
    href="#value"><SAMP>value</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. Only the checked radio button in the group generates a name/value 
    pair in the submitted data. One radio button in each group should be 
    initially checked using the <A 
    href="#checked"><SAMP>checked</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. <PRE>    &lt;input type=radio name=age value="0-12"&gt;

    &lt;input type=radio name=age value="36-"&gt;
</PRE>
    <DT><SAMP>type=submit</SAMP> 
    <DD>This defines a button that users can click to submit the form's contents 
    to the server. The button's label is set from the <A 
    href="#value"><SAMP>value</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. If the <A 
    href="#name"><SAMP>name</SAMP></A> 
    attribute is given then the submit button's name/value pair will be included 
    in the submitted data. You can include several submit buttons in the form. 
    See <SAMP>type=image</SAMP> for graphical submit buttons. <PRE>    &lt;input type=submit value="Party on ..."&gt;</PRE>
    <DT><SAMP>type=image</SAMP> 
    <DD>This is used for graphical submit buttons rendered by an image rather 
    than a text string. The URL for the image is specified with the <A 
    href="#isrc"><SAMP>src</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. The image alignment can be specified with the <A 
    href="#ialign"><SAMP>align</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. In this respect, graphical submit buttons are treated identically 
    to <A 
    href="#img"><SAMP>IMG</SAMP></A> 
    elements, so you can set align to left, right, top, middle or bottom. The x 
    and y values of the location clicked are passed to the server: In the 
    submitted data, image fields are included as two name/value pairs. The names 
    are derived by taking the name of the field and appending ".x" for the x 
    value, and ".y" for the y value. <PRE>&lt;p&gt;Now choose a point on the map:

    &lt;input type=image name=point src="map.gif"&gt;</PRE>
    <P><EM><B>Note</B>: image fields typically cause problems for text-only and 
    speech-based user agents!</EM></P>
    <DT><SAMP>type=reset</SAMP> 
    <DD>This defines a button that users can click to reset form fields to their 
    initial state when the document was first loaded. You can set the label by 
    providing a <A 
    href="#value"><SAMP>value</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. Reset buttons are never sent as part of the form's contents. <PRE>    &lt;input type=reset value="Start over ..."&gt;</PRE>
    <DT><SAMP>type=file</SAMP> 
    <DD>This provides a means for users to attach a file to the form's contents. 
    It is generally rendered by text field and an associated button which when 
    clicked invokes a file browser to select a file name. The file name can also 
    be entered directly in the text field. Just like type=text you can use the 
    <A 
    href="#isize"><SAMP>size</SAMP></A> 
    attribute to set the visible width of this field in average character 
    widths. You can set an upper limit to the length of file names using the <A 
    href="#maxlen"><SAMP>maxlength</SAMP></A> 
    attribute. Some user agents support the ability to restrict the kinds of 
    files to those matching a comma separated list of MIME content types given 
    with the <SAMP>ACCEPT</SAMP> attribute e.g. <SAMP>accept="image/*"</SAMP> 
    restricts files to images. Further information can be found in <A 
    href="#rfc1867">RFC 
    1867</A>. <PRE>    &lt;input type=file name=photo size=20 accept="image/*"&gt;</PRE>
    <DT><SAMP>type=hidden</SAMP> 
    <DD>These fields should not be rendered and provide a means for servers to 
    store state information with a form. This will be passed back to the server 
    when the form is submitted, using the name/value pair defined by the 
    corresponding attributes. This is a work around for the statelessness of 
    HTTP. Another approach is to use HTTP "<A 
    href="#refs">Cookies</A>".

<P>Used to insert images. <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> is an empty element and so the end 
tag is forbidden. Images can be positioned vertically relative to the current 
textline or floated to the left or right. See <SAMP>BR</SAMP> with the 
<SAMP>CLEAR</SAMP> attribute for control over textflow. <PRE><I>e.g.</I>  &lt;IMG SRC="canyon.gif" ALT="Grand Canyon"&gt;</PRE>
<P><SAMP>IMG</SAMP> elements support the following attributes: 
<DL>
  <DT><B>src</B> 
  <DD>This attribute is required for every <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> element. It 
  specifies a URL for the image resource, for instance a GIF, JPEG or PNG image 
  file. 
  <DT><B>alt</B> 
  <DD>This is used to provide a text description of the image and is vital for 
  interoperability with speech-based and text only user agents. 
  <DT><B>align</B> 
  <DD>This specifies how the image is positioned relative to the current 
  textline in which it occurs: 
  <P><!-- fix for Netscape spacing bug with DD --></P>
  <DL>
    <DT><SAMP>align=top</SAMP> 
    <DD>positions the top of the image with the top of the current text line. 
    User agents vary in how they interpret this. Some only take into account 
    what has occurred on the text line prior to the IMG element and ignore what 
    happens after it. 
    <DT><SAMP>align=middle</SAMP> 
    <DD>aligns the middle of the image with the baseline for the current 
    textline. 
    <DT><SAMP>align=bottom</SAMP> 
    <DD>is the default and aligns the bottom of the image with the baseline. 
    <DT><SAMP>align=left</SAMP> 
    <DD>floats the image to the current left margin, temporarily changing this 
    margin, so that subsequent text is flowed along the image's righthand side. 
    The rendering depends on whether there is any left aligned text or images 
    that appear earlier than the current image in the markup. Such text (but not 
    images) generally forces left aligned images to wrap to a new line, with the 
    subsequent text continuing on the former line. 
    <DT><SAMP>align=right</SAMP> 
    <DD>floats the image to the current right margin, temporarily changing this 
    margin, so that subsequent text is flowed along the image's lefthand side. 
    The rendering depends on whether there is any right aligned text or images 
    that appear earlier than the current image in the markup. Such text (but not 
    images) generally forces right aligned images to wrap to a new line, with 
    the subsequent text continuing on the former line. </DD></DL>
  <P>Note that some browsers introduce spurious spacing with multiple left or 
  right aligned images. As a result authors can't depend on this being the same 
  for browsers from different vendors. See <A 
  href="#br"><SAMP>BR</SAMP></A> 
  for ways to control text flow. </P>
  <DT><B>width</B> 
  <DD>Specifies the intended width of the image in pixels. When given together 
  with the height, this allows user agents to reserve screen space for the image 
  before the image data has arrived over the network. 
  <DT><B>height</B> 
  <DD>Specifies the intended height of the image in pixels. When given together 
  with the width, this allows user agents to reserve screen space for the image 
  before the image data has arrived over the network. 
  <DT><B>border</B> 
  <DD>When the <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> element appears as part of a hypertext link, the 
  user agent will generally indicate this by drawing a colored border (typically 
  blue) around the image. This attribute can be used to set the width of this 
  border in pixels. Use <SAMP>border=0</SAMP> to suppress the border altogether. 
  User agents are recommended to provide additional cues that the image is 
  clickable, e.g. by changing the mouse pointer. 
  <DT><B>hspace</B> 
  <DD>This can be used to provide white space to the immediate left and right of 
  the image. The <SAMP>HSPACE</SAMP> attribute sets the width of this white 
  space in pixels. By default <SAMP>HSPACE</SAMP> is a small non-zero number. 
  <DT><B>vspace</B> 
  <DD>This can be used to provide white space above and below the image The 
  <SAMP>VSPACE</SAMP> attribute sets the height of this white space in pixels. 
  By default <SAMP>VSPACE</SAMP> is a small non-zero number. 
  <DT><B>usemap</B> 
  <DD>This can be used to give a URL fragment identifier for a client-side image 
  map defined with the <A 
  href="#map">MAP</A> 
  element. 
  <DT><B>ismap</B> 
  <DD>When the <SAMP>IMG</SAMP> element is part of a hypertext link, and the 
  user clicks on the image, the <SAMP>ISMAP</SAMP> attribute causes the location 
  to be passed to the server. This mechanism causes problems for text-only and 
  speech-based user agents. Whenever its possible to do so use the 
  <SAMP>MAP</SAMP> element instead. </DD></DL>
<P>Here is an example of how you use <SAMP>ISMAP</SAMP>: <PRE>&lt;a href="/cgibin/navbar.map"&gt;&lt;img src=navbar.gif ismap border=0&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</PRE>
<P>The location clicked is passed to the server as follows. The user agent 
derives a new URL from the URL specified by the <SAMP>HREF</SAMP> attribute by 
appending `?' the x coordinate `,' and the y coordinate of the location in 
pixels. The link is then followed using the new URL. For instance, if the user 
clicked at at the location x=10, y=27 then the derived URL will be: 
<I>"<SAMP>/cgibin/navbar.map?10,27</SAMP>"</I>. It is generally a good idea to 
suppress the border and use graphical idioms to indicate that the image is 
clickable. 
<P>Note that pixel values refer to screen pixels, and should be multiplied by an 
appropriate factor when rendering to very high resolution devices such as laser 
printers. For instance if a user agent has a display with 75 pixels per inch and 
is rendering to a laser printer with 600 dots per inch, then the pixel values 
given in HTML attributes should be multiplied by a factor of 8.

<P>Requires start and end tags. This element is supported by all Java enabled 
browsers. It allows you to embed a Java applet into HTML documents. 
<SAMP>APPLET</SAMP> uses associated <A 
href="#param"><SAMP>PARAM</SAMP></A> 
elements to pass parameters to the applet. Following the <SAMP>PARAM</SAMP> 
elements, the content of <SAMP>APPLET</SAMP> elements should be used to provide 
an alternative to the applet for user agents that don't support Java. It is 
restricted to text-level markup as defined by the <I><SAMP>%text</SAMP></I> 
entity in the DTD. Java-compatible browsers ignore this extra HTML code. You can 
use it to show a snapshot of the applet running, with text explaining what the 
applet does. Other possibilities for this area are a link to a page that is more 
useful for the Java-ignorant browser, or text that taunts the user for not 
having a Java-compatible browser.

<DL>
  <DT><B>size</B> 
  <DD>This sets the font size for the contents of the font element. You can set

attribute is case sensitive. 
<P>The <SAMP>AREA</SAMP> element is an empty element and so the end tag is 
forbidden. It takes the following attributes: <SAMP>SHAPE</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>COORDS</SAMP>, <SAMP>HREF</SAMP>, <SAMP>NOHREF</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>ALT</SAMP>. The <SAMP>SHAPE</SAMP> and <SAMP>COORDS</SAMP> attributes 
define a region on the image. If the <SAMP>SHAPE</SAMP> attribute is omitted, 
<SAMP>SHAPE="RECT"</SAMP> is assumed. 
<DL>
  <DD><B>shape=rect coords="</B><I>left-x<B>,</B> top-y<B>,</B> right-x<B>,</B> 
  bottom-y</I><B>"</B>

  x<SUB>3</SUB><B>,</B>y<SUB>3</SUB><B>,</B> ...</I><B>"</B> </DD></DL>
<P>Where <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> are measured in pixels from the left/top of the 
associated image. If <B>x</B> and <B>y</B> values are given with a percent sign 
as a suffix, the values should be interpreted as percentages of the image's 
width and height, respectively. For example: <PRE>   SHAPE=RECT COORDS="0, 0, 50%, 100%"</PRE>
<P>The <SAMP>HREF</SAMP> attribute gives a URL for the target of the hypertext 
link. The <SAMP>NOHREF</SAMP> attribute is used when you want to define a region 
that doesn't act as a hotzone. This is useful when you want to cut a hole in an 
underlying region acting as a hotzone. 
<P>If two or more regions overlap, the region defined first in the map 
definition takes precedence over subsequent regions. This means that 
<SAMP>AREA</SAMP> elements with <SAMP>NOHREF</SAMP> should generally be placed 
before ones with the <SAMP>HREF</SAMP> attribute. 
<P>The <SAMP>ALT</SAMP> attribute is used to provide text labels which can be 
displayed in the status line as the mouse or other pointing device is moved over 
hotzones, or for constructing a textual menu for non-graphical user agents. 
Authors are <B>strongly recommended</B> to provide meaningful <SAMP>ALT</SAMP> 
attributes to support interoperability with speech-based or text-only user 
agents.

        Date: Tuesday January 14th 1997

        Author: Dave Raggett &lt;dsr@w3.org&gt;

        HTML 3.2 aims to capture recommended practice as of early '96
        and as such to be used as a replacement for HTML 2.0 (RFC 1866).
        Widely deployed rendering attributes are included where they
        have been shown to be interoperable. SCRIPT and STYLE are
        included to smooth the introduction of client-side scripts
        and style sheets. Browsers must avoid showing the contents
        of these element Otherwise support for them is not required.
        ID, CLASS and STYLE attributes are not included in this version
        of HTML.

&lt;!--================== The LINK Element ==================================--&gt;

&lt;!ENTITY % Types "CDATA"
        -- See Internet Draft: draft-ietf-html-relrev-00.txt
           LINK has been part of HTML since the early days
           although few browsers as yet take advantage of it.

           Relationship values can be used in principle:

                a) for document specific toolbars/menus when used
                   with the LINK element in the document head:
                b) to link to a separate style sheet
                c) to make a link to a script
                d) by stylesheets to control how collections of
                   html nodes are rendered into printed documents
                e) to make a link to a printable version of this document
                   e.g. a postscript or pdf version
--&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST LINK
        href    %URL    #IMPLIED    -- URL for linked resource --
        rel     %Types  #IMPLIED    -- forward link types --

&lt;!ENTITY % Length "CDATA"   -- nn for pixels or nn% for percentage length --&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % Pixels "NUMBER"  -- integer representing length in pixels --&gt;

&lt;!-- Suggested widths are used for negotiating image size
     with the module responsible for painting the image.
     align=left or right cause image to float to margin
     and for subsequent text to wrap around image --&gt;

&lt;!ENTITY % IAlign "(top|middle|bottom|left|right)"&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT IMG    - O EMPTY --  Embedded image --&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST IMG

        ismap   (ismap)  #IMPLIED   -- use server image map --
        &gt;

&lt;!-- USEMAP points to a MAP element which may be in this document
  or an external document, although the latter is not widely supported --&gt;

&lt;!--=================== Java APPLET tag ===================================--&gt;
&lt;!--
  This tag is supported by all Java enabled browsers. Applet resources
  (including their classes) are normally loaded relative to the document
  URL (or &lt;BASE&gt; element if it is defined). The CODEBASE attribute is used
  to change this default behavior. If the CODEBASE attribute is defined then
  it specifies a different location to find applet resources. The value
  can be an absolute URL or a relative URL. The absolute URL is used as is
  without modification and is not effected by the documents &lt;BASE&gt; element.
  When the codebase attribute is relative, then it is relative to the
  document URL (or &lt;BASE&gt; tag if defined).
--&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT APPLET - - (PARAM | %text)*&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST APPLET
        codebase %URL     #IMPLIED   -- code base --
